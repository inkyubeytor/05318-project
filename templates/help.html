                The system provides recommendations by comparing information
                about the contents of the first 10 chapters of each story.
                It encodes the contents of each story as a vector.
                While these vectors work well for text, the system may make
                mistakes in judging similarity for works that contain an
                abundance of special characters, such as some LitRPGs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that the system can currently only work with the top 1000
                stories on RoyalRoad.
            </p>

            <p>
                If no stories are provided, the recommender will default to
                producing random recommendations.
            </p>
            <p>
                If recommendations are made on the basis of similar stories,
                the system will provide a similarity score indicating how close
                a recommendation is to a story or set of stories. These scores
                have an average value of 50.
            </p>

            <p>
                Users can find and add stories to the Likes and Dislikes in
                order to tune the recommender results. They can also exclude
                recommendations from appearing in results without having to
                mark them as liked or disliked.
            </p>
            <p>
                Keep an eye out for system messages, which provide more
                information about what the system is doing internally.
